# Dark Firefox

**A Firefox Theme**

I recently made the switch from Chrome to Firefox but I wasn't satisfied with the browser.
I have used [Dark Horizon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-horizon/ncjjeokpcnllmmbbipeaagmdpdpiadin) for the entire time I have used chrome so I made this theme to appear similar to that.

[Here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/959024) are instructions for installation.
